I am writing to apply for the open position of a **Reinforcement Learning Engineer** at your company.

I am a researcher at the University of Melbourne and have been working on problems in reinforcement learning (RL) and distributed computing. The focus of my work has been around designing workflows and data pipelines that standardize the way we conduct experiments in RL. I am working extensively with the Ray distributed computing framework, and the university's high performance computing systems; benchmarking RL algorithms and helping create a unified database for other researchers to use. I have recently submitted a number of transcripts with Dr. Joseph West on this work, and hope to have some nice publications by the end of this year.    

I am intrigued to learn more about the position at hand. In my experience, projects on RL and optimization in the industry are incredibly difficult to find. I have a strong foundation in both practical and theoretical RL. I also carry experience from the industry working in roles as a software developer and a data scientist. I am comfortable with Python, common RL frameworks like TorchRL and Rllib, deep learning and optimization libraries, and cloud development with AWS. I lack experience in Rust or TypeScript, but I am a fast learner and for a project of this nature, I will quickly adapt and develop any required skills.     

I am excited to know more about this project and will look forward to speaking with your team. Please reach out to me if you have any questions about my work.
