        - University of Melbourne
        - J. West
        - P. Dalmia
      notes:
        - We analyze the effects of promoting causal influence on the overall cooperation between agents in MARL. We conduct a through experimental analysis motivated by the recent advances in experimental reinforcement learning and discuss the results in detail. We see that causal influence is an effective variable to improve coordination in reinforcement learning.

        - P. Dalmia
      notes:
        - Population based training approach is an interesting alternative to random hyper parameter search in RL. However its compatiblity with modern evaluation protocols for reinforcement learning is understudied. Our results show that PBT may improve computation time while retaining the statistical rigour in RL.
